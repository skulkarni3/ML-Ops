# ML-Ops Project

This project demonstrates the use of **ML-Ops** practices with **MLflow** and **DVC** (Data Version Control).
We utilized DVC to track datasets, automate data preprocessing, and manage the ML pipeline.
MLflow was used for tracking experiments, managing models, and organizing the machine learning workflow.
This setup ensures reproducibility, version control for data, and streamlined collaboration for machine learning projects.
