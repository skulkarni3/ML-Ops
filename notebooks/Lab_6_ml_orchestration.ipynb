    "# ML Pipeline Orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several tools available for orchestrating an ML pipeline. [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) is very popular, and is a powerful general purpose tool, and better than a simple scheduler, but may not be the best choice for ML pipelines. [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/) is a popular alternative to look into as well. For this session, we will be looking at [Metaflow](https://metaflow.org/), an open source tool created at Netflix specifically to make it easier for non-engineering data scientists to create workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Metaflow also does experiment tracking, similar to MLFlow. Also note that Metaflow is in active development, and is therefore more likely to have bugs, or changes, but they do have an active [Slack channel](http://slack.outerbounds.co/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The *problem* with orchestration engines is that they are complex, and we can easily spend many weeks learning how to use just one of these tools, and then there is no guarantee that the company you end up working at will be using the same tool. Because of this, we will only scratch the surface of Metaflow in order to understand and appreciate the idea of setting up *flows* for our work, without getting too bogged down in all of the details of scaling up and out. Let's keep it simple and save the struggle for when you're actually getting paid to wrestle with technology.\n"

    "## Metaflow Basics\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "`pip install metaflow`  \n",
    "`metaflow`  \n",
    "`metaflow --help`   \n",
    "\n",
    "We should add this to our requirements.txt file.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define a flow (DAG) as a class which will be derived from metaflow's `FlowSpec` class, and we can define a step (node) of that flow as a method of our class (which we can name whatever we want), which will be annotated with the `@step` decorator. Here's a quick example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from metaflow import FlowSpec, step\n",
    "\n",
    "class HelloWorldFlow(FlowSpec):\n",
    "    @step\n",
    "    def start(self):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Starting point\"\"\"\n",
    "        print(\"This is start step\")\n",
    "        self.next(self.hello)\n",
    "\n",
    "    @step\n",
    "    def hello(self):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Say hi\"\"\"\n",
    "        print(\"Hello World!\")\n",
    "        self.next(self.end)\n",
    "\n",
    "    @step\n",
    "    def end(self):\n",
    "         \"\"\"Finish line\"\"\"\n",
    "         print(\"This is end step\")\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "     HelloWorldFlow()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's pick this apart. We created our own flow, which we called `HelloWorldFlow`, as a subclass of `FlowSpec`. Our flow has three steps denoted by the `@step` decorator. We explicitly define a `start` and `end` step. Note that the first step must be called `start` and the last step must be called `end`. We define the edges of our DAG, how one step flows to the next, by calling `next(step_name)` where `step_name` is the next step/node in the flow/DAG. We can only have one flow in a single python file, and we instantiate the flow using `if __name__ == '__main__':` so that it runs if we call the file as a script. We can save all of this into a python file called `helloworld.py` and then run:\n",
    "\n",
    "`python helloworld.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "Metaflow will not run the flow, it will simply check that the DAG is valid, and will run a linter to check our code. We will need to `pip install pylint` for this to work. We should see that the DAG is good and that pylint is happy. Let's go back and make the DAG invalid and rerun the code to see what happens. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can see a representation of the DAG by running \n",
    "\n",
    "`python helloworld.py show`\n",
    "\n",
    "After verifying the DAG is what we want, we can run the flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "`python helloworld.py run`\n",
    "\n",
    "This will run the flow and we will see lines of output like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`2023-03-09 13:01:19.142 [1678395679097777/start/1 (pid 86303)] Task is starting.`\n",

    "- process ID: pid 86303  \n",
    "- log message: Task is starting.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these IDs help us track our experiments. Each run of the flow gets a unique run ID, and each task is processed separately and gets their own process ID. The combination of a run ID, step name, and task ID defines a *pathspec* which uniquely identifies a task and might come in handy later.\n"

    "### Data flow\n",
    "\n",
    "When processing data we need to be cognizant of how our workflow will access input data, and how that data will flow through the workflow. Commonly, in data science workflows, we would like to persist a state between steps in the workflow, meaning that we don't want each step of the workflow to be independent of others steps, we want to transfer the state of each step to the next step in the workflow. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that in Jupyter we can run code cells out of order, which means that unexpected things may change. Defining a workflow helps to alleviate that issue, and ensures that code is run in a specific order, and that variables that were defined in a previous step will persist to subsequent steps. With Metaflow we can persist states by using a common data store, which is managed internally by Metaflow. \n",
    "\n",
    "Persisting data is as simple as creating *instance* variables, which means, all we have to do is assign any variables or data that we want to persist to `self`. Anything assigned to `self` is also called an *artifact*, and these artifacts can be any python object (scalar, model, dataframe, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to persist states in this way because each task in the workflow is executed separately, which may happen on different physical CPUs. Here's an example of persisting state:\n",

    "# ML Workflows Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating ML flows is necessary when moving models out of development notebooks and into production-ready code. There are many ways to do this, but creating DAGs, whether through a tool, or through a collection of scripts and shell scripts that run in a specific order, is the default. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal in this lab is to create two flows, one for training our model (using the same dataset we selected for the previous MLFlow labs), and one for model scoring (sometimes called inference), and run these flows locally. We will likely modify our training flow later when we move Metaflow to GCP, and our scoring flow later when we get to the model deployment section of the course. We will also integrate MLFlow model registration with our flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation and Creating a Training Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install Metaflow in your project environment and add it to the requirements.txt file.  \n",
    "2. Use the `FlowSpec` class and the `@step` decorator to create a flow that will train your model on your local machine. You *might* have steps such as: ingest raw data; feature transformations; hyperparameter tuning; choose best model; and register and save model using the MLFlow model registry (*with MLFlow running locally for now*). You can modularize your code so that different steps can be in different flows, or more commonly so that different steps of the same flow can be imported from other modules. For example, data transformations can be written in a separate script and imported into a specific step in your flow like this:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "@step\n",
    "def start(self):\n",
    "    import dataprocessing\n",
    "```  \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Be sure to add parameters to your flow when it makes sense, for example, for cross-validation or setting seeds.  \n",
    "4. Save your flow in the `src` folder as `trainingflow.py`. Run your training flow to register a new \"best\" model in MLFlow using the parameters from your previously registered \"best\" model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Scoring FLow\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Create a model scoring flow for making predictions from your registered model on new data. You *might* have steps such as: ingest new data; feature transformations; load the registered model; make predictions; and output predictions. Again, you may have separate scripts for each of these steps which can be imported into the steps of the flow. \n",
    "6. Save your flow in the `src` folder as `scoringflow.py`. Run your scoring flow on a set of data that was not used for model training, or simply save a hold-out set of data from the training set and use this to demonstrate your scoring flow.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Turning It In\n",
    "\n",
    "Push your flows to Github. **Do not add the `.metaflow/` folder to git**. Submit the Github URL that goes directly to the `src` folder. Be sure to add comments to your scripts so that they are easy to read."
